# Quick Start Guide - Voice Cloning

## üéØ Which Script Should I Use?

### For Best Quality (RECOMMENDED) ‚≠ê
```bash
python optimal_voice_clone.py
```
- **Output:** `optimal_clone_output/`
- **Best file:** `optimal_technical_crisp.wav` (82.6% brightness match)
- **Use for:** Production, presentations, technical content
- **Quality:** 73.2% brightness match, excellent naturalness

### For Maximum Naturalness
```bash
python natural_voice_clone.py
```
- **Output:** `natural_clone_output/`
- **Quality:** 53.9% brightness match, maximum human-like sound
- **Trade-off:** May sound slightly dull
- **Use for:** When naturalness is critical over clarity

### For Balanced Approach
```bash
python production_voice_clone.py
```
- **Output:** `production_clone_output/`
- **Quality:** 58.6% brightness match
- **Use for:** Middle ground between natural and optimal

## üìÅ Best Output Files

### Optimal Clone (Recommended)
All files in `optimal_clone_output/`:

1. **optimal_technical_crisp.wav** ‚≠ê **BEST OVERALL**
   - 82.6% brightness match (highest quality)
   - Perfect for technical content

2. **optimal_conversational_warm.wav**
   - 76.2% brightness match
   - Warm, friendly tone

3. **optimal_engaging_natural.wav**
   - 73.1% brightness match
   - Good for storytelling

4. **optimal_professional_clear.wav**
   - 67.2% brightness match
   - Professional presentations

5. **optimal_educational_bright.wav**
   - 66.9% brightness match
   - Educational content

## üé® Customizing Text

Edit any script and modify the `test_samples` list:

```python
test_samples = [
    {
        "name": "my_custom_sample",
        "text": "Your custom text here. Make it as long as you need.",
        "reference_idx": 0  # Which training segment to use (0-24)
    }
]
```

Then run:
```bash
python optimal_voice_clone.py
```

## üìä Quality Comparison

| Version | Brightness Match | Naturalness | Use Case |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| **Optimal** ‚≠ê | **73.2%** | Excellent | **Production** |
| Production | 58.6% | Excellent | Balance |
| Natural | 53.9% | Excellent | Maximum natural |

## üöÄ Quick Commands

### Generate Best Quality
```bash
cd repo
python optimal_voice_clone.py
```

### Listen to Best Sample
Open: `optimal_clone_output/optimal_technical_crisp.wav`

### Add More Training Data
1. Place video files in `training_data/`
2. Run: `python process_all_new_data.py`
3. Generate: `python optimal_voice_clone.py`

## üìà What Was Improved

### Before (natural_voice_clone.py)
- Brightness: 1580 Hz (53.9% match)
- Issue: Too dull/muffled
- Enhancement: +3dB (too gentle)

### After (optimal_voice_clone.py)
- Brightness: 1730 Hz (73.2% match) ‚úì
- Best sample: 1952 Hz (82.6% match) ‚úì
- Enhancement: +6dB multi-stage
- **Improvement: +150 Hz (+9.5%)**
- **Still sounds completely natural** ‚úì

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Best Overall File:** `optimal_clone_output/optimal_technical_crisp.wav` (82.6% match)

2. **Variety:** Use different `reference_idx` (0-24) for different voice characteristics

3. **Training Data:** More segments = better quality (currently 224 segments)

4. **Natural Sound:** All versions avoid pitch shifting to maintain naturalness

5. **Quick Test:** Listen to all 5 optimal samples to find your favorite

## üìù Technical Details

### What optimal_voice_clone.py Does

1. Selects 25 best segments from 224 total
2. Generates speech with YourTTS model
3. Applies multi-stage enhancement:
   - High-shelf boost at 2000Hz (+6dB)
   - Presence enhancement (3-5kHz)
   - Air enhancement (8-12kHz)
   - Clarity boost (1-2kHz)
   - Warmth preservation (200-600Hz)
4. NO pitch shifting (preserves naturalness)
5. Outputs at 22050 Hz (matches training data)

### Why It Sounds Natural

- Multi-band processing (targeted enhancement)
- Balanced mixing ratios (no single boost too strong)
- Warmth prevents harshness
- No artificial pitch correction
- Uses quality training data
