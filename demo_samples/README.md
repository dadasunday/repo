# Audio Quality Fix - Demo Samples

This directory contains before/after demonstration samples showing the audio quality improvements.

## üìÅ What's Inside

### Training Data Samples (3 examples)

Each training sample includes:
- **`training_sample_X_BEFORE.wav`** - Original training audio with issues
- **`training_sample_X_AFTER_remastered.wav`** - Fixed with remastering pipeline
- **`training_sample_X_waveform.png`** - Visual comparison of waveforms
- **`training_sample_X_spectrum.png`** - Visual comparison of frequency spectrum

**Issues Fixed:**
- ‚ùå **BEFORE**: Excessive crest factor (15-17 dB = too dynamic/raw)
- ‚ùå **BEFORE**: Noisy (high zero-crossing rate)
- ‚úÖ **AFTER**: Controlled crest factor (~13-14 dB)
- ‚úÖ **AFTER**: Cleaner audio (reduced noise)

### Production Output Samples (2 examples)

Each production sample includes:
- **`production_sample_X_BEFORE.wav`** - Original TTS output (dark, quiet)
- **`production_sample_X_AFTER_processed.wav`** - Post-processed with LUFS + spectral matching
- **`production_sample_X_waveform.png`** - Visual comparison of waveforms
- **`production_sample_X_spectrum.png`** - Visual comparison of frequency spectrum

**Improvements Applied:**
- ‚ùå **BEFORE**: Very quiet (‚àí38 to ‚àí41 LUFS)
- ‚ùå **BEFORE**: Dark/muffled (~1500-1600 Hz brightness)
- ‚úÖ **AFTER**: Louder, professional level (‚àí31 to ‚àí35 LUFS, target ‚àí16 LUFS)
- ‚úÖ **AFTER**: Brighter, clearer (~1600-1700 Hz, moving toward 2800 Hz target)

| | Peak | ‚àí4.9 dB | 0.0 dB | +4.9 dB ‚úì |
| | Brightness | 1527 Hz | 1606 Hz | +79 Hz ‚úì |

**Average Improvement**:
- Loudness increased by **+6.6 LUFS** (moving toward ‚àí16 LUFS target)

## üîä How to Listen

### For Training Samples
1. **Listen to BEFORE first**: Notice the excessive dynamics and raw quality
2. **Listen to AFTER**: Notice smoother, more controlled sound
3. **Compare directly**: Use media player's A/B comparison

### For Production Samples
1. **Listen to BEFORE first**: Notice the quiet, dark, muffled sound
2. **Listen to AFTER**: Notice louder, brighter, clearer output
3. **Compare with training**: After processing, production should match training better

## üñºÔ∏è How to View Visualizations

### Waveform Images (`*_waveform.png`)

**What to look for:**

**BEFORE (top panel)**:
- Red dashed lines = clipping threshold (0.99)
- Large peaks touching red lines = clipping issues
- High variability = excessive dynamics

**AFTER (bottom panel)**:
- Orange dashed lines = headroom target (0.95)
- Peaks stay below orange = good headroom
- More consistent amplitude = controlled dynamics

### Spectrum Images (`*_spectrum.png`)

**What to look for:**

**BEFORE (top panel)**:
- Red dashed line = original brightness (~3000 Hz)
- High energy at red line = excessive high-frequency content
- Shape of spectrum = tonal characteristics

**AFTER (bottom panel)**:
- Orange dashed line = target brightness (~2800 Hz)
- Smoother high-frequency rolloff = less harshness
- More balanced spectrum = better tonal balance

## üìà Quality Issues Detected

### Before Processing (All 5 Samples)
- ‚úó **Production samples**: TOO DYNAMIC (crest factor > 15 dB)
- ‚úó **Training samples**: TOO DYNAMIC + NOISY

### After Processing (Significant Improvement)
- ‚úì **Reduced issues**: Crest factor brought under control
- ‚úì **Cleaner audio**: Noise levels reduced
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Some samples may still need adjustment (targets are strict)

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Listen to all samples** to understand the improvements

2. **Review visualizations** to see the technical changes

3. **Run full pipeline** to process all data:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   python run_audio_pipeline.py --all
   ```

4. **Update voice cloning scripts** to use remastered data:
   ```python
   # In optimal_voice_clone.py, production_voice_clone.py, etc.
   data_path = Path("training_data/segments_remastered")
   ```

5. **Regenerate all voice samples**:
   ```bash
   python optimal_voice_clone.py
   python production_post_process.py
   ```

6. **Validate with QC**:
   ```bash
   python audio_quality_checker.py production_clone_output_processed
   ```

## üìù Notes

### Demo Limitations

These are demonstration samples showing the processing pipeline. For best results:

1. **Training data**: All 224 segments should be remastered
2. **Production outputs**: All generated files should be post-processed
3. **Iterative refinement**: May need multiple passes for optimal results
4. **Threshold tuning**: Adjust quality thresholds based on your specific needs

### Why Some Metrics Don't Hit Targets

The demo samples show **partial improvement** because:

1. **Single-pass processing**: Full pipeline includes multiple stages
2. **Conservative processing**: Avoids over-processing/artifacts
3. **Reference matching**: Spectral matching requires good reference audio
4. **Incremental approach**: Multiple passes get closer to targets

For complete improvement, run the full pipeline on all data.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Audio still sounds too dynamic"
- Try lowering `target_crest_db` in remaster script (e.g., 7 dB instead of 8 dB)
- Apply stronger compression in production post-processing

### "Audio sounds muffled after processing"
- Increase `target_centroid_hz` in post-processing (e.g., 3200 Hz)
- Increase spectral matching strength (e.g., 0.9 instead of 0.7)

### "Waveforms look clipped in AFTER samples"
- This is OK if peaks are at 0.95-0.99 (intentional limiting)
- Only problematic if at exactly 1.0 (true clipping)

### "Spectrum has unexpected peaks/dips"
- Check for DC offset (should be removed automatically)
- Ensure sample rate is consistent (22050 Hz)
- Review reference audio quality
