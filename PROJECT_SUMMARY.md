## 🎯 Project Overview

Successfully built a high-quality voice cloning system that can generate natural-sounding speech matching your voice characteristics.

---

## 📊 Training Data Journey

### Initial State
- **6 audio segments** from original raw_audio.wav
- ~3.8 seconds average per segment
- Limited voice variety

### Final State
- **224 audio segments** (37x expansion!)
- **6 training videos** processed (Training videos 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
- **~10 minutes** total training audio
- High-quality segmentation with silence detection
- Located in: `training_data/segments_final_merged/`

### Processing Pipeline
1. Extract audio from videos (ffmpeg via imageio-ffmpeg)
2. Segment audio based on silence (2-10 second clips)
3. Quality filtering (RMS > 0.02, good duration)
4. Merge with original segments
5. Select best segments using quality scoring

- **Audio Normalization:** Prevents clipping, preserves dynamics
- **Soft Clipping:** tanh function for natural limiting
- **Warmth Addition:** 200-500Hz boost prevents harshness
- **Presence Boost:** 3-5kHz for clarity
- **Air Enhancement:** 8-10kHz for sparkle

### 3. Smart Segment Selection

  - RMS levels (good energy)
  - Spectral characteristics (clarity)
  - No clipping

### 4. Dynamic Range Processing
- **Gentle:** 1.10x expansion (natural)

## 🎯 What We Learned

### ✅ What Works
1. More training data = better quality (6 → 224 segments)
2. Gentle processing > aggressive processing
3. Let model handle pitch naturally
4. Warmth prevents harsh/artificial sound
5. Quality segment selection matters
6. Matching sample rate is critical (22kHz)

### ❌ What Doesn't Work
1. Pitch shifting = artificial/robotic sound
2. Excessive brightness boost = harsh
3. Over-processing = unnatural
4. Too few training segments = poor quality
5. Ignoring sample rate = quality loss

### 🎓 Trade-offs Discovered
- **Metrics vs Naturalness:** High numbers ≠ good sound
- **Brightness vs Warmth:** Need balance
- **Processing vs Natural:** Less is often more
- **Pitch accuracy vs Prosody:** Can't force both
